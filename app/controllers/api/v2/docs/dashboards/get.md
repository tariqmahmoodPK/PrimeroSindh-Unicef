      "type": "indicator",
      "indicators": {
        "workflow":{
          "new": {
            "count": 1,
            "query": ["record_state=true","status=open","workflow=new"]
          },
          "care_plan": {
            "count": 0,
            "query": ["record_state=true","status=open","workflow=care_plan"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

A 2-D dashboard:
